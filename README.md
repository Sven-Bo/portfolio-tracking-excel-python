# Dividend & Portfolio Tracker in Excel by using Python [Free Template]

In this tutorial, I will show you the Excel Dividend & Portfolio Tracker I have built for you. All you need to do is to enter the Ticker Symbol, the number of shares you own as well as your average purchase price.

The Excel Spreadsheet is pulling the financial data from Yahoo Finance by using Python. It is not only limited to US stock. You could return any stock, cryptocurrency, forex, mutual fund & ETF data which is available on Yahoo Finance.

In this video, I will show you:
1. how to use this template
2. how you can build your own portfolio tracker from scratch
3. and last but not least, how to customize this template to your needs and liking
